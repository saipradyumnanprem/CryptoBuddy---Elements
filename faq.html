            <strong>Crypto is taxed in the same way as Gold and real estate. When you sell or trade crypto you have to pay tax on the difference between the selling price and the price you bought it for (minus any exchange fees).
            </strong> This is known as a Capital Gains Tax and has to be paid in most countries such as the USA, UK, Canada etc.
